# mc-irc-bridge

A minecraft server to IRC channel bridge bot

Usage example:

`ruby irc.rb -s irc.freenode.org -c balmoralmc -f minecraft/console.pipe -l minecraft/server.log`

This ruby bot was created by John Hawthorn. This code was taken from [John's website](https://www.johnhawthorn.com/2011/06/minecraft-to-irc-bridge/).

The init script for using screen to init/launch/communicate with/maintain the minecraft server process was taken from [Server_starup_script](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Server_startup_script).

Requirements:
-------------

* A computer capable of being used as a minecraft server (Most kinds of Linux should work)
* ruby
* python
* screen

Initially this does not yet work as-is. I will later update the code to what works for me and then will provide detailed installation instructions.
